cfde_registry_dcc:hmp	The Human Microbiome Project	The Human Microbiome Project    Characterization of healthy and disease-associated human microbiomes using multiple 'omics technologies	abrady@som.umaryland.edu	Arthur Brady	https://www.hmpdacc.org/
cfde_registry_dcc:gtex	Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)	The aim of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project is to increase our understanding of how changes in our genes affect human health and disease with the ultimate goal of improving health care for future generations. It was launched in 2010 as a two-year pilot project supported by the Office of the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH). GTEx will create a database that researchers can use to study how inherited changes in genes lead to common diseases.	jnedzel@broadinstitute.org	Jared Nedzel	https://gtexportal.org
cfde_registry_dcc:motrpac	MoTrPAC Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium	MoTrPAC is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans.	kdalton@stanford.edu	Karen Dalton	https://motrpac.org
cfde_registry_dcc:kidsfirst	The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program	A large-scale data resource to help researchers uncover new insights into the biology of childhood cancer and structural birth defects	achar@ucdavis.edu	Amanda Charbonneau	https://kidsfirstdrc.org/
cfde_registry_dcc:metabolomics	The Metabolomics Consortium Coordinating Center	The mission of the M3C is to serve as a catalyst for the advancement of metabolomics in biomedical research and clinical care by engaging the diverse range of stakeholders, organizing the consortium, and promoting its work. Stakeholder engagement will include bi-annual symposia to identify roadblocks in the use of metabolomics and suggest approaches leading to remediation. Pilot and Feasibility awards will be focused on biomedical research projects new to the use of metabolomics.  Consortium work will be organized through this web portal providing access to all consortium resources, including access to datasets in the National Metabolomics Data Repository, and tools developed by the Metabolomics Data Analysis and Interpretation Tools awardees.  M3C further organizes the work of the consortium by facilitating on-line and in-person meetings of governance groups and workgroups.  M3C promotes the work of the consortium through social media (@metabinfo), its web portal, presentations at scientific meetings, and distribution of consortium standards, policies, procedures, protocols, best practices, and guidelines. M3C develops a strategic plan for the consortium, generates metrics regarding the activities of the consortium, participates in evaluation, and creates the consortium annual report. The work of the coordinating center, and of the metabolomics consortium, will lead to improved human health through basic research findings, improved laboratory practices, and translation to clinical research and care.	shsubramaniam@ucsd.edu	Shankar Subramaniam	https://metabolomics.info/
cfde_registry_dcc:lincs	Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures	The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Program aims to create a network-based understanding of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular processes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing agents.	avi.maayan@mssm.edu	Avi Ma'ayan	http://www.lincsproject.org/
cfde_registry_dcc:4dn	4D Nucleome Data Coordination and Integration Center	The 4D Nucleome (4DN) Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) aims to collect, store, curate, display, and analyze data generated in the 4DN Network. The DCIC is a collaboration of two centers from three institutions: Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and The Washington University in St. Louis (WashU). The Harvard/MIT DCIC is tasked with building the infrastructure for data collection and integration. The Harvard/MIT and WashU centers will collaborate on the development and incorporation of novel data visualization tools. The 4DN Data Portal is accessible at data.4dnucleome.org.	support@4dnucleome.org	4DN Team	http://dcic.4dnucleome.org/
