library	a multiplexed library is a material entity which is the output of a library preparation process that uses a ligation step to attach a unique multiplexing sequence identifier to a specific sample, then mixes several such tagged samples prior to the library amplification process proper. A multiplexed library allows the sequencing of several samples in one sequencing run.	OBI:0001970	multiplexed sequencing library
