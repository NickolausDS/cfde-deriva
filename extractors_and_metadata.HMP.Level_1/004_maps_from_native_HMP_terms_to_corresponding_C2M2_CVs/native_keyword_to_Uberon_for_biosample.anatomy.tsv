FMA:10382	The costovertebral joints are the articulations that connect the heads of the ribs with the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae. Joining of ribs to the vertebrae occurs at two places, the head and the tubercle of the rib. Two convex facets from the head attach to two adjacent vertebrae. This forms a trochoid joint, which is strengthened by the ligament of the head and the intercapital ligament. Articulation of the tubercle is to the transverse process of the adjacent vertebrae. This articulation is reinforced by the dorsal costotransverse ligament. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002292	costovertebral joint
FMA:10419	A duct that collects and carries secretions of the exocrine pancreas to the intestine.	UBERON:0007329	pancreatic duct
FMA:10420	The main excretory tubular canal that connects the parotid gland and the buccal mucosa and secretes a serous saliva into the vestibule of the oral cavity; it arises from the anterior surface of the gland, traversing the masseter muscle; the duct then pierces the buccinator muscle, moving medially, and opens out into the oral cavity near the second upper molar; saliva produced by acinar secretory cells in the glandular body flows sequentially through the intercalated ducts, striated ducts, and excretory ducts.	UBERON:0001065	parotid main excretory duct
FMA:10425	Interchondral Articulations (articulations of the cartilages of the ribs with each other). The contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh, and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. Each articulation is enclosed in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally and medially by ligamentous fibers which pass from one cartilage to the other. Sometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous fibers.

FMA:10636	The costocervical trunk arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery, behind the scalenus anterior on the right side, and medial to that muscle on the left side. Passing backward, it splits into the deep cervical artery and the supreme intercostal artery (or the Highest intercostal artery), which descends behind the pleura in front of the necks of the first and second ribs, and anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal (3rd posterior intercostal artery). As it crosses the neck of the first rib it lies medial to the anterior division of the first thoracic nerve, and lateral to the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. In the first intercostal space, it gives off a branch which is distributed in a manner similar to the distribution of the aortic intercostals. The branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the highest aortic intercostal artery. This branch is not constant, but is more commonly found on the right side; when absent, its place is supplied by an intercostal branch from the aorta. Each intercostal gives off a posterior branch which goes to the posterior vertebral muscles, and sends a small spinal branch through the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the medulla spinalis and its membranes.

FMA:12525	Vertebra prominens is the proper name for the seventh cervical vertebra. The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process which is palpable from the skin surface, hence the name. This spinous process is thick, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, but terminating in a tubercle to which the lower end of the ligamentum nuchae is attached. The seventh cervical vertebra (C7) has the most prominent spinous process only in about 70% of people; in the remainder, either C6 or T1 (the first thoracic vertebra) will be the most prominent. The transverse processes are of considerable size, their posterior roots are large and prominent, while the anterior are small and faintly marked; the upper surface of each has usually a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom presents more than a trace of bifurcation. The foramen transversarium may be as large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but is generally smaller on one or both sides; occasionally it is double, sometimes it is absent. On the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides; but the usual arrangement is for both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, and not through the foramen. Sometimes the anterior root of the transverse process attains a large size and exists as a separate bone, which is known as a cervical rib.	UBERON:0004616	mammalian cervical vertebra 7

FMA:12774	A lymph node that is part of a mediastinum. Each consists of several lymph node groups, especially along the trachea (5 groups), along the esophagus and between the lung and the diaphragm. In the mediastinal lymph nodes arises lymphatic ducts, which draines the lymph to the left subclavian vein (to the venous angle in the confluence of the subclavian and deep jugular veins). The mediastinal lymph nodes along the esophagus are in tight connection with the abdominal lymph nodes along the esophagus and the stomach. That fact facilitates spreading of tumors cells through these lymphatics in cases of cancers of the stomach and particularly of the esophagus. Through the mediastinum, the main lymphatic drainage from the abdominal organs goes via the thoracic duct (ductus thoracicus), which drains majority of the lymph from the abdomen to the above mentioned left venous angle.

FMA:13318	The anterior jugular vein begins near the hyoid bone by the confluence of several superficial veins from the submaxillary region. It descends between the median line and the anterior border of the Sternocleidomastoideus, and, at the lower part of the neck, passes beneath that muscle to open into the termination of the external jugular, or, in some instances, into the subclavian vein. It varies considerably in size, bearing usually an inverse proportion to the external jugular; most frequently there are two anterior jugulars, a right and left; but sometimes only one. Its tributaries are some laryngeal veins, and occasionally a small thyroid vein. Just above the sternum the two anterior jugular veins communicate by a transverse trunk, the venous jugular arch, which receive tributaries from the inferior thyroid veins; each also communicates with the internal jugular. There are no valves in this vein. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0001104	anterior jugular vein

FMA:13361	Traditional gross anatomy divided the liver into four lobes based on surface features. The falciform ligament is visible on the front (anterior side) of the liver. This divides the liver into a left anatomical lobe, and a right anatomical lobe.	UBERON:0001113	lobe of liver
FMA:13362	The right lobe is much larger than the left; the proportion between them being as six to one. It occupies the right hypochondrium, and is separated from the left lobe on its upper surface by the falciform ligament; on its under and posterior surfaces by the left sagittal fossa; and in front by the umbilical notch. It is of a somewhat quadrilateral form, its under and posterior surfaces being marked by three fossæ: the porta and the fossæ for the gall-bladder and inferior vena cava, which separate its left part into two smaller lobes; the quadrate and caudate lobes. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0001114	right lobe of liver
FMA:13363	The left lobe is smaller and more flattened than the right. It is situated in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions.

FMA:13364	The quadrate lobe is an area of the liver situated on the under surface of the right lobe, bounded in front by the anterior margin of the liver; behind by the porta hepatis; on the right, by the fossa for the gall-bladder; and on the left, by the fossa for the umbilical vein. It is oblong in shape, its antero-posterior diameter being greater than its transverse. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0001116	quadrate lobe of liver
FMA:13365	The caudate lobe (posterior hepatic segment I, Spigelian lobe) is situated upon the postero-superior surface of the liver on the right lobe of the liver, opposite the tenth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae. It is bounded on the left side by the physiological division of the liver called the ligamentum venosum. It is bounded, below, by the porta; on the right, by the fossa for the inferior vena cava; and, on the left, by the fossa for the ductus venosus. It looks backward, being nearly vertical in position; it is longer from above downward than from side to side, and is somewhat concave in the transverse direction. The caudate process is a small elevation of the hepatic substance extending obliquely and laterally, from the lower extremity of the caudate lobe to the under surface of the right lobe. It is situated behind the porta, and separates the fossa for the gall-bladder from the commencement of the fossa for the inferior vena cava. Budd-Chiari syndrome, caused by occlusion of hepatic venous outflow, can lead to hypertrophy of the caudate lobe due to its own caval anastomosis that allows for continued function of this lobe of the liver.

FMA:14518	The body of the pancreas is a subsection of the pancreas organ in the human body. It is somewhat prismatic in shape, and has three surfaces: anterior, posterior, and inferior. It is at the same level as the transpyloric plane. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0001150	body of pancreas
FMA:14519	The tail of the pancreas, located anatomically left near the hilum of the spleen, is not simply an anatomical distinction. The tail is the only part of the pancreas which contains Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP) cells, which are responsible for secreting pancreatic polypeptide to coordinate exocrine and islet enzyme release. PP cells are found in the tail's periphery. Beta cells and delta cells are found in the central part of the tail as with the rest of the pancreas. The cells described above are located exclusively in the islet cells; their secretions reach exocrine portions of the pancreas via the capillary network surrounding the islet cell populations.

FMA:14572	The lesser curvature of the stomach, extending between the cardiac and pyloric orifices, forms the right or posterior border of the stomach. It descends as a continuation of the right margin of the esophagus in front of the fibers of the right crus of the diaphragm, and then, turning to the right, it crosses the first lumbar vertebra and ends at the pylorus. Nearer its pyloric than its cardiac end is a well-marked notch, the incisura angularis, which varies somewhat in position with the state of distension of the viscus; it serves to separate the stomach into a right and a left portion. The lesser curvature gives attachment to the two layers of the hepatogastric ligament, and between these two layers are the left gastric artery and the right gastric branch of the hepatic artery.

FMA:14627	The abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. There is a common set of layers covering and forming all the walls: the deepest being the extraperitoneal fat, the parietal peritoneum, and a layer of fascia which has different names over where it covers (eg transversalis, psoas fascia). Superficial to these, but not present in the posterior wall are the three layers of muscle, the transversus abdominis (transverse abdominal muscle), the internal (obliquus internus) and the external oblique (obliquus externus).

FMA:14719	The paracolic gutters (paracolic sulci, paracolic recesses) are spaces between the colon and the abdominal wall. There are two paracolic gutters: The right lateral paracolic gutter. The left lateral paracolic gutter. These gutters are clinically important because they allow a passage for infectious fluids from different compartments of the abdomen. For example; fluid from an infected appendix can track up the right paracolic gutter to the hepatorenal recess.	UBERON:0035210	paracolic gutter
FMA:14727	Between the rectum and the bladder the peritoneal cavity forms, in the male, a pouch, the rectovesical excavation (or rectovesical pouch), the bottom of which is slightly below the level of the upper ends of the vesiculae seminalesbi. e. , about 7.5 cm. from the orifice of the anus. its lowest part membranous partition called Rectoprostatic fascia.

FMA:14728	The rectouterine pouch (or rectouterine excavation, rectovaginal, Ehrhardt-Cole Recess or Pouch of Douglas) is the extension of the peritoneal cavity between the rectum and back wall of the uterus in the female human body. The rectouterine pouch is used in the treatment of end-stage renal failure in patients who are treated by peritoneal dialysis. The tip of the dialysis catheter is placed into the deepest point of the pouch. In women it is the deepest point of the peritoneal cavity, posterior to (behind) the uterus and anterior to (in front of) rectum. (The pouch on the other side of the uterus is the vesicouterine excavation. ) It is near the posterior fornix of the vagina. In men, the region corresponding to the rectouterine pouch is the rectovesical excavation, which lies between the urinary bladder and rectum. (There is no equivalent to the vesicouterine excavation.)	UBERON:0007111	Douglas' pouch
FMA:14729	The peritoneum over the rectum and the bladder is continued over the intestinal surface and fundus of the uterus on to its vesical surface, which it covers as far as the junction of the body and cervix uteri, and then to the bladder, forming here a second, but shallower, pouch, the vesicouterine excavation (or uterovesical pouch). The vesicouterine excavation is close to the anterior fornix of the vagina.	UBERON:0011049	uterovesical pouch

FMA:14734	The inferior phrenic arteries are two small vessels, which supply the diaphragm but present much variety in their origin. They may arise separately from the front of the aorta, immediately above the celiac artery, or by a common trunk, which may spring either from the aorta or from the celiac artery. Sometimes one is derived from the aorta, and the other from one of the renal arteries; they rarely arise as separate vessels from the aorta. They diverge from one another across the crura of the diaphragm, and then run obliquely upward and lateralward upon its under surface. The left phrenic passes behind the esophagus, and runs forward on the left side of the esophageal hiatus. The right phrenic passes behind the inferior vena cava, and along the right side of the foramen which transmits that vein. Near the back part of the central tendon each vessel divides into a medial and a lateral branch. The medial branch curves forward, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries. The lateral branch passes toward the side of the thorax, and anastomoses with the lower intercostal arteries, and with the musculophrenic. The lateral branch of the right phrenic gives off a few vessels to the inferior vena cava; and the left one, some branches to the esophagus. Each vessel gives off superior suprarenal branches to the suprarenal gland of its own side. The spleen and the liver also receive a few twigs from the left and right vessels respectively.	UBERON:0012255	inferior phrenic artery
FMA:14735	The lumbar arteries are in series with the intercostals. They are usually four in number on either side, and arise from the back of the aorta, opposite the bodies of the upper four lumbar vertebrC&. A fifth pair, small in size, is occasionally present: they arise from the middle sacral artery. They run lateralward and backward on the bodies of the lumbar vertebrC&, behind the sympathetic trunk, to the intervals between the adjacent transverse processes, and are then continued into the abdominal wall. The arteries of the right side pass behind the inferior vena cava, and the upper two on each side run behind the corresponding crus of the diaphragm. The arteries of both sides pass beneath the tendinous arches which give origin to the Psoas major, and are then continued behind this muscle and the lumbar plexus. They now cross the Quadratus lumborum, the upper three arteries running behind, the last usually in front of the muscle. At the lateral border of the Quadratus lumborum they pierce the posterior aponeurosis of the Transversus abdominis and are carried forward between this muscle and the Obliquus internus. They anastomose with the lower intercostal, the subcostal, the iliolumbar, the deep iliac circumflex, and the inferior epigastric arteries.	UBERON:0006636	lumbar artery
FMA:14749	Mesenteric artery that supplies the whole length of the small intestine except the superior part of the duodenum.

FMA:14754	The middle suprarenal arteries (middle capsular arteries; suprarenal arteries) are two small vessels which arise, one from either side of the abdominal aorta, opposite the superior mesenteric artery. They pass laterally and slightly upward, over the crura of the diaphragm, to the suprarenal glands, where they anastomose with suprarenal branches of the inferior phrenic and renal arteries. In the fetus these arteries are of large size.	UBERON:0012173	middle suprarenal artery
FMA:14757	The median sacral artery (or middle sacral artery) is a small vessel, which arises from the back of the aorta, a little above its bifurcation. It descends in the middle line in front of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebræ, the sacrum and coccyx, and ends in the glomus coccygeum (coccygeal gland). From it, minute branches are said to pass to the posterior surface of the rectum. On the last lumbar vertebra it anastomoses with the lumbar branch of the iliolumbar artery; in front of the sacrum it anastomoses with the lateral sacral arteries, and sends offsets into the anterior sacral foramina. It is crossed by the left common iliac vein, and is accompanied by a pair of venæ comitantes; these unite to form a single vessel, which opens into the left common iliac vein.

FMA:14764	The common iliac arteries are two large arteries, about 4cm long in adults but more than a centimetre in diameter, that originate from the aortic bifurcation. The arteries run inferolaterally, along the medial border of the psoas muscles to the pelvic brim, where they bifurcate into the external iliac artery and internal iliac artery. The common iliac artery, and all of its branches, exist as paired structures (that is to say, there is one on the left side and one on the right). The distribution of the common iliac artery is basically the pelvis and lower limb on the corresponding side. Both common iliac arteries are accompanied along their course by common iliac veins.

FMA:14771	In anatomy, the common hepatic artery is a short blood vessel that supplies oxygenated blood to the liver, pylorus (a part of the stomach), duodenum (a part of the small intestine) and pancreas. It arises from the celiac artery and has the following branches:	UBERON:0005436	common hepatic artery
FMA:14772	The hepatic artery proper (also proper hepatic artery), arises from the common hepatic artery and runs alongside the portal vein and the common bile duct to form the portal triad. The hepatic artery proper gives off a small supraduodenal artery to the duodenal bulb. Then the right gastric artery comes off and runs to the left along the lesser curvature of the stomach to meet the left gastric artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. It subsequently gives off the cystic artery, which feeds the gallbladder, before bifurcating into the right and left hepatic arteries. Of note, the right and left hepatic arteries may demonstrate variant anatomy.

FMA:19090	The pubococcygeus muscle or PC muscle is a hammock-like muscle, found in both sexes, that stretches from the pubic bone to the coccyx (tail bone) forming the floor of the pelvic cavity and supporting the pelvic organs. It is part of the levator ani group of muscles.	UBERON:0011528	pubococcygeus muscle
FMA:19091	The fibers which form a sling for the rectum are named the Puborectalis or Sphincter recti. They arise from the lower part of the symphysis pubis, and from the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm. They meet with the corresponding fibers of the opposite side around the lower part of the rectum, and form for it a strong sling. Relaxation reduces the angle between rectum and anus, allowing defecation in conjunction with relaxation of the internal and external sphincters. Puborectalis is part of the levator ani group of muscles.	UBERON:0011512	puborectalis muscle

FMA:19607	The pampiniform plexus is a network of many small veins found in the male spermatic cord. It is formed by the union of multiple spermatic veins from the back of the testis and tributaries from the epididymis. The veins of the plexus ascend along the cord in front of the ductus deferens. Below the subcutaneous inguinal ring they unite to form three or four veins, which pass along the inguinal canal, and, entering the abdomen through the abdominal inguinal ring, coalesce to form two veins. These again unite to form a single vein, the testicular vein, which opens on the right side into the inferior vena cava, at an acute angle, and on the left side into the left renal vein, at a right angle. The pampinoform plexus forms the chief mass of the cord. In addition to its function in venous return from the testes, the pampiniform plexus also plays a role in the temperature regulation of the testes. It acts as a heat exchanger, cooling blood in adjacent arteries. An abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform plexus is a medical condition called varicocele. [WP,unvetted].

FMA:224787	Haversian canals are a series of tubes around narrow channels formed by lamellae. This is the region of bone called compact bone. Osteons are arranged in parallel to the long axis of the bone. The Haversian canals surround blood vessels and nerve cells throughout the bone and communicate with osteocytes in lacunae (spaces within the dense bone matrix that contain the living bone cells) through canaliculi. This unique arrangement is conducive to mineral salt deposits and storage which gives bone tissue its strength.	UBERON:0014731	haversian canal

FMA:224850	The anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, lying in front of the motor and premotor areas.nnThis brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behaviors, personality expression, decision making and moderating correct social behavior. The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.nnThe most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the pre-frontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social 'control' (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially-unacceptable outcomes).nnMany authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex. - definition adapted from Wikipedia	UBERON:0000451	prefrontal cortex
FMA:224852	The premotor cortex is an area of motor cortex lying within the frontal lobe of the brain. It extends 3 mm anterior to the primary motor cortex, near the Sylvian fissure, before narrowing to approximately 1 mm near the medial longitudinal fissure, which serves as the posterior border for the prefrontal cortex. The premotor cortex is largely equivalent to Brodmann area 6. Activity within this region is critical to the sensory guidance of movement and control of proximal and trunk muscles of the body.

FMA:22834	The superficial palmar arch is formed predominantly by the ulnar artery, with a contribution from the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. However, in some individuals the contribution from the radial artery might be absent, and instead anastomoses with either the princeps pollicis artery, the radialis indicis artery, or the median artery, the former two of which are branches from the radial artery. Alternative names for this arterial arch are: superficial volar arch, superficial ulnar arch, arcus palmaris superficialis, or arcus volaris superficialis. The arch passes across the palm in a curve with its convexity downward. If one were to fully extend the thumb, the superficial palmar arch would lie approximately at the level of a line drawn from the distal border of the thumb across the palm. The superficial palmar arch is more distal than the deep palmar arch. Three common palmar digital arteries arise from the arch, proceeding down on the second, third, and fourth lumbrical muscles, respectively.

FMA:23239	The lateral border (or axillary border, or margin) is the thickest of the three borders of the scapula. It begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely downward and backward to the inferior angle. Immediately below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression, the infraglenoid tuberosity, about 2.5 cm. in length, which gives origin to the long head of the Triceps brachii; in front of this is a longitudinal groove, which extends as far as the lower third of this border, and affords origin to part of the Subscapularis. The inferior third is thin and sharp, and serves for the attachment of a few fibers of the Teres major behind, and of the Subscapularis in front.	UBERON:0007173	lateral border of scapula
FMA:23242	The medial border of the scapula (vertebral border, medial margin) is the longest of the three borders, and extends from the medial to the inferior angle. It is arched, intermediate in thickness between the superior and the axillary borders, and the portion of it above the spine forms an obtuse angle with the part below. This border presents an anterior and a posterior lip, and an intermediate narrow area. The anterior lip affords attachment to the Serratus anterior; the posterior lip, to the Supraspinatus above the spine, the Infraspinatus below; the area between the two lips, to the Levator scapulC& above the triangular surface at the commencement of the spine, to the Rhomboideus minor on the edge of that surface, and to the Rhomboideus major below it; this last is attached by means of a fibrous arch, connected above to the lower part of the triangular surface at the base of the spine, and below to the lower part of the border.

FMA:276189	The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC or DLPFC), according to a more restricted definition, is roughly equivalent to Brodmann areas 9 and 46.[1] According to a broader definition DL-PFC consists of the lateral portions of Brodmann areas 9 - 12, of areas 45, 46, and the superior part of area 47.[2] These regions mainly receive their blood supply from the middle cerebral artery. With respect to neurotransmitter systems, there is evidence that dopamine plays a particularly important role in DL-PFC.[2]DL-PFC is connected to the orbitofrontal cortex, and to a variety of brain areas, which include the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex, including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas	UBERON:0009834	dorsolateral prefrontal cortex

FMA:27935	Deep fascia (or 'investing fascia') is a layer of fascia which can surround individual muscles, and divide groups of muscles into compartments. This is the dense fibrous connective tissue that interpenetrates and surrounds the muscles, bones, nerves and blood vessels of the body. It provides connection and communication in the form of aponeuroses, ligaments, tendons, retinacula, joint capsules, and septa. The deep fasciae envelop all bone; cartilage, and blood vessels and become specialized in muscles and nerves. The high density of collagen fibers is what gives the deep fascia its strength and integrity. The amount of elastin fiber determines how much extensibility and resilience it will have.

More recent researches, however, show that this part of the tongue is mainly, if not entirely, developed from a pair of lateral swellings which rise from the inner surface of the mandibular arch and meet in the middle line. The site of their meeting remains post-embryonically as the median sulcus of the tongue. The tuberculum impar is said to form the central part of the tongue immediately in front of the foramen cecum, but Hammar insists that it is purely a transitory structure and forms no part of the adult tongue[WP, Gray's].

FMA:32851	The hemispheric articular surface at the upper extremity of the thigh bone[Stedman, 26th ed]. The femur head is the highest part of the thigh bone. It is supported by the neck of the femur. The head is globular and forms rather more than a hemisphere, is directed upward, medialward, and a little forward, the greater part of its convexity being above and in front. Its surface is smooth, coated with cartilage in the fresh state, except over an ovoid depression, the fovea capitis femoris, which is situated a little below and behind the center of the head, and gives attachment to the ligament of head of femur. If there is a fracture of the neck of the femur, the blood supply through the ligament becomes crucial. In orthopedic surgery, the head of the femur is important because it can undergo avascular necrosis and consequent osteochondritis dissecans. The head is removed in total hip replacement surgery [WP].	UBERON:0006767	head of femur
FMA:32852	The greater trochanter (great trochanter) of the femur is a large, irregular, quadrilateral eminence and a part of the skeletal system. It is directed a little lateralward and backward, and, in the adult, is about 1 cm lower than the head. Because the pelvic outlet in the female is larger than in the male, there is a greater distance between the greater trochanters in the female. It has two surfaces and four borders. [WP,unvetted].

FMA:32855	A condyle that is part of a distal epiphysis of femur.	UBERON:0009980	condyle of femur
FMA:32858	The medial condyle is one of the two projections on the lower extremity of femur. The medial condyle is larger than the lateral (outer) condyle due to more weight bearing caused by the center of gravity being medial to the knee. On the posterior surface of the condyle the linea aspera (a ridge running down the posterior shaft of the femur) turns into the medial supracondylar ridge. The outermost protrusion on the medial surface of the medial condyle is referred to as the 'medial epicondyle' and can be palpated by running fingers medially from the patella with the knee in flexion.	UBERON:0009984	medial condyle of femur
FMA:32859	The lateral condyle is one of the two projections on the lower extremity of femur. It is the more prominent and is the broader both in its antero-posterior and transverse diameters	UBERON:0009985	lateral condyle of femur
FMA:32864	The medial epicondyle of the femur is a bony protrusion located on the medial side of the bone's distal end. Located above the medial condyle, it bears an elevation, the adductor tubercle, which serves for the attachment of the superficial part, or 'tendinous insertion', of the adductor magnus. This tendinous part here forms an intermuscular septum which forms the medial separation between the thigh's flexors and extensors. Behind it, and proximally to the medial condyle is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of the Gastrocnemius.	UBERON:0009987	medial epicondyle of femur
FMA:32867	The lateral epicondyle of the femur, smaller and less prominent than the medial epicondyle, gives attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint. Directly below it is a small depression from which a smooth well-marked groove curves obliquely upward and backward to the posterior extremity of the condyle.

FMA:37072	The axillary nerve is a nerve of the human body, that comes off the posterior cord of the brachial plexus at the level of the axilla (armpit) and carries nerve fibers from C5 and C6. The axillary nerve travels through the quadrangular space with the posterior circumflex humeral artery and vein. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0001493	axillary nerve
FMA:37076	The infraspinatus muscle inserts at this tendon to the distal greater tubercle of the humerus. This tendon stretches across the shoulder joint to attach to the humerus and in doing so acts as a very strong ligament to hold the joint surface in apposition. This structure restricts the movement of the shoulder joint to flexion and extension (together with the suscapularis tendon and the supraspinatus tendon). A bursa lies under this tendon at the greater tubercle of the humerus. The bursa is lined by a synovial membrance and filled with synovial fluid and protects the infraspinatus tendon and the shoulder joint by allowing the transmissions of tension and sheer forces around an angle.

FMA:38854	The humeroulnar joint, is part of the elbow-joint or the Olecron Joint, between the ulna and humerus bones is the simple hinge-joint, which allows for movements of flexion, extension and circumduction. The Humero-Ulnar Joint is the junction of trochlear notch of the ulna and the trochlea of the humerus. Owing to the obliquity of the trochlea of the humerus, this movement does not take place in the antero-posterior plane of the body of the humerus. When the forearm is extended and supinated, the axis of the arm and forearm are not in the same line; the arm forms an obtuse angle with the forearm. During flexion, however, the forearm and the hand tend to approach the middle line of the body, and thus enable the hand to be easily carried to the face. The accurate adaptation of the trochlea of the humerus, with its prominences and depressions, to the semilunar notch of the ulna, prevents any lateral movement. Flexion is produced by the action of the Biceps brachii and Brachialis, assisted by the Brachioradialis, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Extension is produced by the Triceps brachii and AnconC&us, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, such as the Extensor digitorum communis.

FMA:45628	In the circulatory system of animals, a portal venous system occurs when a capillary bed drains into another capillary bed through veins, without first going through the heart. Both capillary beds and the blood vessels that connect them are considered part of the portal venous system. They are relatively uncommon as the majority of capillary beds drain into veins which then drain into the heart, not into another capillary bed. Portal venous systems are considered venous because the blood vessels that join the two capillary beds are either veins or venules. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal system and the hypophyseal portal system. Unqualified, 'portal venous system' often refers to the hepatic portal system. For this reason, 'portal vein' most commonly refers to the hepatic portal vein[WP].	UBERON:0005806	portal system

FMA:46576	The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles are extremely small, paired muscles that extend from the posterior cricoid cartilage to the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx. By rotating the arytenoid cartilages laterally, these muscles abduct the vocal cords and thereby open the rima glottidis. Their action opposes the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles receive innervation from the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X). Paralysis of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles may lead to asphyxiation as they are the only laryngeal muscles to open the true vocal folds, allowing inspiration and expiration.

FMA:46583	The oblique arytenoid, the more superficial Arytenoid muscle, forms two fasciculi, which pass from the base of one cartilage to the apex of the opposite one, and therefore cross each other like the limbs of the letter X; a few fibers are continued around the lateral margin of the cartilage, and are prolonged into the aryepiglottic fold; they are sometimes described as a separate muscle, the Aryepiglotticus. The aryepiglottic muscle together with the transverse arytenoid and the thyroarytenoid work as a sphincter and close the larynx as we swallow or cough. Its innervation is by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (from vagus) just like all the intrinsic muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle.	UBERON:0008575	oblique arytenoid

FMA:46665	The salpingopharyngeus muscle arises from the inferior part of the cartilage of the pharyngotympanic tube (Eustachian tube) in the nasal cavity; it passes downward and blends with the posterior fasciculus of the palatopharyngeus muscle. The salpingopharyngeus is known to raise the pharynx and larynx during deglutition (swallowing) and laterally draws the pharyngeal walls up. In addition, it opens the pharyngeal orifice of the pharyngotympanic tube during swallowing. This allows for the equalization of pressure between the auditory canal and the pharynx. The salpingopharyngeus is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X) via the pharyngeal plexus.	UBERON:0010937	salpingopharyngeus muscle

FMA:46727	The levator veli palatini is the elevator muscle of the velum palatinum in the human body. During swallowing, it contracts, elevating the soft palate to help prevent food from entering the nasopharynx. It is innervated via the pharyngeal plexus, primarily by the vagus nerve (CN X). The levator veli palatini (Levator palati) is a thick, rounded muscle situated lateral to the choanC&. It arises from the under surface of the apex of the petrous part of the temporal bone and from the medial lamina of the cartilage of the auditory tube. After passing above the upper concave margin of the Constrictor pharyngis superior it spreads out in the palatine velum, its fibers extending obliquely downward and medially to the middle line, where they blend with those of the opposite side.

FMA:46768	The galea aponeurotica (epicranial aponeurosis, aponeurosis epicranialis) is a tough layer of dense fibrous tissue which covers the upper part of the cranium; behind, it is attached, in the interval between its union with the Occipitales, to the external occipital protuberance and highest nuchal lines of the occipital bone; in front, it forms a short and narrow prolongation between its union with the Frontales. On either side it gives origin to the Auriculares anterior and superior; in this situation it loses its aponeurotic character, and is continued over the temporal fascia to the zygomatic arch as a layer of laminated areolar tissue. It is closely connected to the integument by the firm, dense, fibro-fatty layer which forms the superficial fascia of the scalp: it is attached to the pericranium by loose cellular tissue, which allows the aponeurosis, carrying with it the integument to move through a considerable distance.

FMA:46798	The Depressor Supercilii is an eye muscle of the human body. The nature of this muscle is in some dispute. Few printed anatomies include it (Netter, et al. ) and many authorities consider it to be part of the orbicularis oculi muscle . On the other hand, many dermatologists, ophthalmologists and plastic surgeons hold that the depressor supercilli is a distinct muscle and has a definite, individual effect on the movement of the eybrow and skin of the glabella.

FMA:46805	The levator labii superioris (or quadratus labii superioris) is a broad sheet, the origin of which extends from the side of the nose to the zygomatic bone. Its medial fibers form the angular head, which arises by a pointed extremity from the upper part of the frontal process of the maxilla and passing obliquely downward and lateralward divides into two slips. One of these is inserted into the greater alar cartilage and skin of the nose; the other is prolonged into the lateral part of the upper lip, blending with the infraorbital head and with the Orbicularis oris. The intermediate portion or infraorbital head arises from the lower margin of the orbit immediately above the infraorbital foramen, some of its fibers being attached to the maxilla, others to the zygomatic bone. Its fibers converge, to be inserted into the muscular substance of the upper lip between the angular head and the Caninus. The lateral fibers, forming the zygomatic head, arise from the malar surface of the zygomatic bone immediately behind the zygomaticomaxillary suture and pass downward and medialward to the upper lip.

FMA:51061	The Achilles tendon is a tendon of the posterior leg. It serves to attach the plantaris, gastrocnemius (calf) and soleus muscles to the calcaneus (heel) bone.	UBERON:0003701	calcaneal tendon
FMA:51062	The triceps surae is a pair of muscles located at the calf - the gastrocnemius and the soleus. These muscles both insert into the calcaneus, the bone of the heel of the human foot, and form the major part of the muscle of the back part of the lower leg, commonly known as the calf muscle. The triceps surae is connected to the foot through the Achilles tendon, and has 3 heads deriving from the 2 major masses of muscle. The superficial portion (the gastrocnemius) gives off 2 heads attaching to the base of the femur directly above the knee.

FMA:52930		UBERON:0018398	superior alveolar nerve
FMA:52931	The posterior superior alveolar branches (posterior superior dental branches) arise from the trunk of the maxillary nerve just before it enters the infraorbital groove; they are generally two in number, but sometimes arise by a single trunk. They descend on the tuberosity of the maxilla and give off several twigs to the gums and neighboring parts of the mucous membrane of the cheek. They then enter the posterior alveolar canals on the infratemporal surface of the maxilla, and, passing from behind forward in the substance of the bone, communicate with the middle superior alveolar nerve, and give off branches to the lining membrane of the maxillary sinus and gingival and dental branches to each molar tooth from a superior dental plexus; these branches enter the apical foramina at the roots of the teeth. The posterior superior alveolar nerve innervates the second and third maxillary molars, and two of the three roots of the maxillary first molar (all but the mesiobuccal root). When giving a Posterior Superior Alveolar nerve block, it will anesthetize the mesialbuccal root of the maxillary first molar approximately 72% of the time.

It lies between the superior nasal conchC& and middle nasal conchC&; the sphenopalatine foramen opens into it behind, and the posterior ethmoidal cells in front. The sphenoidal sinus opens into a recess, the sphenoethmoidal recess, which is placed above and behind the superior concha.	UBERON:0007163	superior nasal meatus
FMA:53139	The middle meatus is a nasal opening or canal situated between the middle and inferior conchae, and extends from the anterior to the posterior end of the latter. The lateral wall of this meatus can be satisfactorily studied only after the removal of the middle concha. On it is a curved fissure, the hiatus semilunaris, limited below by the edge of the uncinate process of the ethmoid and above by an elevation named the bulla ethmoidalis; the middle ethmoidal cells are contained within this bulla and open on or near to it. Through the hiatus semilunaris the meatus communicates with a curved passage termed the infundibulum, which communicates in front with the anterior ethmoidal cells and in rather more than fifty percent of skulls is continued upward as the frontonasal duct into the frontal air-sinus; when this continuity fails, the frontonasal duct opens directly into the anterior part of the meatus. Below the bulla ethmoidalis and hidden by the uncinate process of the ethmoid is the opening of the maxillary sinus (ostium maxillare); an accessory opening is frequently present above the posterior part of the inferior nasal concha.

FMA:53228	The chorda tympani is a nerve that branches from the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) inside the facial canal, just before the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. Chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (the seventh cranial nerve) that serves the taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain. The chorda tympani is part of one of three cranial nerves that are involved in taste. The taste system involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of other nerves. The chorda tympani appears to exert a particularly strong inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain fibers in the tongue. When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, leading to less inhibited activity in the other nerves.	UBERON:0009675	chorda tympani branch of facial nerve

FMA:54820	The filiform papillae are thin, long 'V'-shaped cones that don't contain taste buds but are the most numerous. These papillae are mechanical and not involved in gustation covering most of the dorsum (upper surface). They are small and arranged in lines parallel to the V-shaped row of circumvallate papillae, except at the tip of the tongue where they are aligned transversely. Projecting from their apices are numerous filamentous processes, or secondary papillae. These are of a whitish tint, owing to the thickness and density of the epithelium of which they are composed. This epithelium has undergone a peculiar modification as the cells have become cornified and elongated into dense, imbricated, brush-like processes. They contain also a number of elastic fibers, which render them firmer and more elastic than the papillae of mucous membrane generally. The larger and longer papillae of this group are sometimes termed papillae conicae. Fungiform papillae are found dispersed throughout the filiform papillae. [WP,unvetted].

In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin by oligodendroglia cells is formed. Schwann cells form myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells also make a thin covering in an axon without myelin (in the PNS). A peripheral nerve fiber contains an axon, myelin sheath, schwann cells and its endoneurium. There are no endoneurium and schwann cells in the central nervous system.	UBERON:0006134	nerve fiber

FMA:59155	Apocrine sweat glands are sweat glands composed of a coiled secretory portion located at the junction of the dermis and subcutaneous fat, from which a straight portion inserts and secretes into the infundibular portion of the hair follicle. The ducts of apocrine glands open into the canals of hair follicles. The stimulus for the secretion of apocrine sweat glands is adrenaline, which is a hormone carried in the blood[WP].	UBERON:0000382	apocrine sweat gland
FMA:59159	Glands of Moll, also known as ciliary glands, are modified apocrine sweat glands that are found on the margin of the eyelid. They are next to the base of the eyelashes, and anterior to the Meibomian glands within the distal eyelid margin. These glands are relatively large and tubular-shaped. The glands of Moll are named after Dutch oculist Jacob Anton Moll (1832-1914). Glands of Moll empty into the adjacent lashes. Glands of Moll and Zeis secrete lipid that adds to the superficial layer of the tear film, retarding evaporation. The glands of Moll are prone to infection and blockage of its duct with sebum and cell debris. Blockage of the gland's duct causes swelling which can manifest itself as a stye.

FMA:5923	Nerve fibers which project from the central nervous system to autonomic ganglia. In the sympathetic division most preganglionic fibers originate with neurons in the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, exit via ventral roots from upper thoracic through lower lumbar segments, and project to the paravertebral ganglia; there they either terminate in synapses or continue through the splanchnic nerves to the prevertebral ganglia. In the parasympathetic division the fibers originate in neurons of the brain stem and sacral spinal cord. In both divisions the principal transmitter is acetylcholine but peptide cotransmitters may also be released.	UBERON:0011925	preganglionic autonomic fiber

FMA:60179	A system of fluid passages in the inner ear, including both the cochlea, which is part of the auditory system, and the vestibular system, which provides the sense of balance. The bony labyrinth, or osseous labyrinth, is the network of passages with bony walls lined with periosteum. The bony labyrinth is lined with the membranous labyrinth. There is a layer of perilymph between them. The three parts of the bony labyrinth are the vestibule of the ear, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea. The vestibular system is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea (the hearing organ). The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. Joint and muscle receptors also are important in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from these systems that control our balance. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0001839	bony labyrinth

FMA:6028	The intercostal nerves are the anterior divisions (rami anteriores; ventral divisions) of the thoracic spinal nerves from T1 to T11. Each nerve is connected with the adjoining ganglion of the sympathetic trunk by a gray and a white ramus communicans. The intercostal nerves are distributed chiefly to the thoracic pleura and abdominal peritoneum and differ from the anterior divisions of the other spinal nerves in that each pursues an independent course without plexus formation. The first two nerves supply fibers to the upper limb in addition to their thoracic branches; the next four are limited in their distribution to the parietes of the thorax; the lower five supply the parietes of the thorax and abdomen. The 7th intercostal nerve terminates at the xyphoid process, at the lower end of the sternum. The 10th intercostal nerve terminates at the umbilicus. The twelfth thoracic is distributed to the abdominal wall and groin. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0003727	intercostal nerve

FMA:61123		UBERON:0001857	anterior semicircular duct
FMA:61126	The semicircular canals are three half-circular, interconnected tubes located inside each ear. The three canals are the horizontal semicircular canal (also known as the lateral semicircular canal), superior semicircular canal (also known as the anterior semicircular canal), and the posterior semicircular canal. The canals are aligned approximately orthogonally to one another. The horizontal canal is aligned roughly horizontally in the head. The superior and anterior canals are aligned roughly at a 45 degree angle to a vertical plane drawn from the nose to the back of the skull. Thus, the horizontal canal detects horizontal head movements (such as when doing a pirouette), while the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements. Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains a motion sensor with little hairs whose ends are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula. As the skull twists in any direction, the endolymph is thrown into different sections of the canals. The cilia detect when the endolymph rushes past, and a signal is then sent to the brain. The semicircular canals are a component of the Labyrinth. Among species of mammals, the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion. Specifically, species that are agile and have fast, jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously.	UBERON:0001858	posterior semicircular duct

It is named by analogy with the mythical maze that imprisoned the Minotaur, because of its appearance. The bony labyrinth, or osseous labyrinth, is the network of passages with bony walls lined with periosteum. The bony labyrinth is lined with the membranous labyrinth. There is a layer of perilymph between them. The three parts of the bony labyrinth are the vestibule of the ear, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea. The vestibular system is the region of the inner ear where the semicircular canals converge, close to the cochlea (the hearing organ). The vestibular system works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. Joint and muscle receptors also are important in maintaining balance. The brain receives, interprets, and processes the information from these systems that control our balance. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002499	cochlear labyrinth

FMA:62064	The Medial forebrain bundle (MFB), is a complex bundle of axons coming from the basal olfactory regions, the periamygdaloid region, and the septal nuclei, and passing to the lateral hypothalamus, with some carrying on into the tegmentum. It contains both ascending and descending fibers. It also represents a part of the mesolimbic pathway, carrying information between the ventral tegmentum and the nucleus accumbens. It is commonly accepted that the MFB is a part of the reward system, involved in the integration of reward and pleasure. Electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle is believed to cause sensations of pleasure. This hypothesis is based upon intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) studies. Animals will work for MFB ICSS, and humans report that MFB ICSS is intensely pleasurable. This is most likely because the medial forebrain bundle carries information from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (nAcc or Acb). The nAcc is a recognized reward center, and activation of the pathway from the VTA to the nAcc is believed to be rewarding, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the hedonic highway.

FMA:62072	Rounded band of white fibers crossing the middle line on the dorsal aspect of the upper end of the cerebral aqueduct. It is important in the bilateral pupillary light reflex. Its fibers acquire their medullary sheaths early, but their connections have not been definitely determined. Most of them have their origin in a nucleus, the nucleus of the posterior commissure (nucleus of Darkschewitsch), which lies in the central gray substance of the upper end of the cerebral aqueduct, in front of the nucleus of the oculomotor nerve. Some are probably derived from the posterior part of the thalamus and from the superior colliculus, whereas others are believed to be continued downward into the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The posterior commissure interconnects the pretectal nuclei, mediating the consensual pupillary light reflex[WP].

As a result, it plays a crucial role in attention, planning, organization, abstract thinking, multi-tasking and active memory. The connections of the medial dorsal nucleus have even been used to delineate the prefrontal cortex of the Göttingen minipig brain. By stereology the number of brain cells in the region has been estimated to around 6.43 million neurons in the adult human brain and 36.3 million glial cells, and with the newborn having quite different numbers: around 11.2 million neurons and 10.6 million glial cells.

FMA:68596	A segmentation of the cerebral cortex on the basis of cytoarchitecture as described in Brodmann-1905, Brodmann-1909 and Brodmann-10. Maps for several species were presented. NeuroNames includes only areas in the human and in Old World monkeys. Of the latter, Brodmann studied representatives of several species including guenons (one Cercopithecus mona, one Cercocebus torquatus, and one Cercopithecus otherwise unspecified), which are all closely related African species, and one macaque (Macaca mulatta) an Asian species (Brodmann-1905). The legend to the summary map in Brodmann-1909 ascribes the areas simply to Cercopithecus. Brodmann referenced the areas by name and number. The same area number in humans and monkeys did not necessarily refer to topologically or cytoarchitecturally homologous structures. In NeuroNames the standard term for human areas consists of the English translation of Brodmann's Latin name followed by the number he assigned, e.g., agranular frontal area 6; the standard terms for monkey areas are in the format: area 6 of Brodmann-1909. He mapped a portion of areas limited to the banks of sulci, e.g., area 3 of Brodmann-1909 (Brodmann-1909) onto the adjacent, visible surface. This accounts for the fact that some areas appear larger on his surface map than on maps of other authors, e.g., area 3 of Vogts-1919. (Adapted from NeuroNames)	UBERON:0013529	Brodmann area

FMA:68600	The term area 4 of Brodmann-1909 refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the guenon. It is located predominantly in the precentral gyrus. Brodmann-1909 regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the human gigantopyramidal area 4 and noted that it occupies a much greater fraction of the frontal lobe in the monkey than in the human. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): the cortex is unusually thick; the layers are not distinct; the cells are relatively sparsely distributed; giant pyramidal (Betz) cells are present in the internal pyramidal layer (V); lack of an internal granular layer (IV) such that the boundary between the external pyramidal layer (III) and the internal pyramidal layer (V) is indistinct; lack of a distinct external granular layer (II); a gradual transition from the multiform layer (VI) to the subcortical white matter.

FMA:68602	Brodmann area 6, or BA6, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to the primary motor cortex, it is composed of the premotor cortex and, medially, the supplementary motor area, or SMA. This large area of the frontal cortex is believed to play a role in the planning of complex, coordinated movements. Brodmann area 6 is also called agranular frontal area 6 in humans because it lacks an internal granular cortical layer (layer IV). It is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined precentral region of cerebral cortex. In the human brain, it is located on the portions of the precentral gyrus that are not occupied by the gigantopyramidal area 4; furthermore, BA6 extends onto the caudal portions of the superior frontal and middle frontal gyri. It extends from the cingulate sulcus on the medial aspect of the hemisphere to the lateral sulcus on the lateral aspect. It is bounded rostrally by the granular frontal region and caudally by the gigantopyramidal area 4 (Brodmann, 1909).	UBERON:0006472	Brodmann (1909) area 6
FMA:68604	Brodmann area 7 is one of Brodmann's cytologically defined regions of the brain. It is involved in locating objects in space.

FMA:68607	Brodmann area 10, or BA10, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. BA10 encompasses the most anterior part of the frontal cortex, known as the frontopolar region. This area is believed to play a part in strategic processes involved in memory retrieval and executive function. This area is also called frontopolar area 10, and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. It occupies the most rostral portions of the superior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. In humans, on the medial aspect of the hemisphere it is bounded ventrally by the superior rostral sulcus (H). It does not extend as far as the cingulate sulcus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, caudally by the middle frontal area 46, and ventrally by the orbital area 47 and by the rostral area 12 or, in an early version of Brodmann's cortical map (Brodmann-1909), the prefrontal Brodmann area 11-1909.

FMA:68609	Brodmann area 12 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It occupies the most rostral portion of the frontal lobe. Brodmann-1909 did not regard it as homologous, either topographically or cytoarchitecturally, to rostral area 12 of the human. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): a quite distinct internal granular layer (IV) separates slender pyramidal cells of the external pyramidal layer (III) and the internal pyramidal layer (V); the multiform layer (VI) is expanded, contains widely dispersed spindle cells and merges gradually with the underlying cortical white matter; all cells, including the pyramidal cells of the external and internal pyramidal layers are inordinately small; the internal pyramidal layer (V) also contains spindle cells in groups of two to five located close to its border with the internal granular layer (IV).

FMA:68610	Brodmann area 13 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex as defined on the guenon monkey and on the basis of cytoarchitecture. Brodmann area 13 is found in humans, however it seems to act as a bridge between the lateral and medial layers of the brain. Thus it is sometimes misidentified as not being a Brodmann area.

FMA:68611	Brodmann Area 14 is one of Brodmann's subdivisions of the cerebral cortex in the brain. It was defined by Brodmann in the guenon monkey. No equivalent structure exists in humans.	UBERON:0013545	Brodmann (1909) area 14
FMA:68612	Brodmann Area 15 is one of Brodmann's subdivisions of the cerebral cortex in the brain. Area 15 was defined by Brodmann in the guenon monkey, but he found no equivalent structure in humans. However, functional imaging experiments have found structures that may be homologous.	UBERON:0013546	Brodmann (1909) area 15
FMA:68613	Brodmann area 16 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is a relatively undifferentiated cortical area that Brodmann regarded as part of the insula because of the relation of its innermost multiform layer (VI) with the claustrum (VICl). The laminar organization of cortex is almost totally lacking. The molecular layer (I) is wide as in area 15 of Brodmann-1905. The space between layer I and layer VI is composed of a mixture of pyramidal cells and spindle cells with no significant number of granule cells. Pyramidal cells clump in the outer part to form glomeruli similar to those seen in some of the primary olfactory areas (Brodmann-1905). This term also refers to an area known as peripaleocortical claustral - a cytoarchitecturally defined (agranular) portion of the insula at its rostral extreme where it approaches most closely the claustrum and the prepyriform area (Stephan-76).

This area is also known as peristriate area 19, and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined occipital region of cerebral cortex. In the human it is located in parts of the lingual gyrus, the cuneus, the lateral occipital gyrus (H) and the superior occipital gyrus (H) of the occipital lobe where it is bounded approximately by the parieto-occipital sulcus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded on one side by the parastriate area 18 which it surrounds. Rostrally it is bounded by the angular area 39 (H) and the occipitotemporal area 37 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

FMA:68617	Brodmann area 20, or BA20, is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. The region encompasses most of the ventral temporal cortex, a region believed to play a part in high-level visual processing and recognition memory. This area is also known as inferior temporal area 20, and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the inferior temporal gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded medially by the ectorhinal area 36 (H), laterally by the middle temporal area 21, rostrally by the temporopolar area 38 (H) and caudally by the occipitotemporal area 37 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

FMA:68618	Brodmann area 21, or BA21, is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. The region encompasses most of the lateral temporal cortex, a region believed to play a part in auditory processing and language. Language function is left lateralized in most individuals. BA21 is superior to BA20 and inferior to BA40 and BA41. This area is also known as middle temporal area 21. It is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the middle temporal gyrus.

FMA:68620	The term area 23 of Brodmann-1909 refers to a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. Brodmann regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the combined ventral posterior cingulate area 23 and dorsal posterior cingulate area 31 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive Features (Brodmann-1905): the cortex is relatively thin; smaller cells predominate; the cell density of the multiform layer (VI) is great, producing a distinct boundary with the subcortical white matter; the internal granular layer (IV) is rather well developed; the internal pyramidal layer (V) contains a dense population of round, medium-sized ganglion cells concentrated at the border with layer IV; layers V and VI are narrow with a distinct mutual boundary.nn* Definition Source NeuroNames	UBERON:0013554	Brodmann (1909) area 23

This area is also known as pars opercularis (of the inferior frontal gyrus), and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Thus, it is bounded caudally by the inferior precentral sulcus (H) and rostrally by the anterior ascending limb of lateral sulcus (H). It surrounds the diagonal sulcus (H). In the depth of the lateral sulcus it borders on the insula. Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally and dorsally by the agranular frontal area 6, dorsally by the granular frontal area 9 and rostrally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909).	UBERON:0006481	Brodmann (1909) area 44
FMA:68642	Part of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human, it occupies the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus (human) and, surrounding the anterior horizontal limb of the lateral sulcus (human), a portion of the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (human). Bounded caudally by the anterior ascending limb of the lateral sulcus (human), it borders on the insula in the depth of the lateral sulcus. Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally by the opercular area 44, rostrodorsally by the area 46 of Brodmann (human) and ventrally by the area 47 of Brodmann (human) (Brodmann-1909) (Adapted from Brain Info)	UBERON:0006482	Brodmann (1909) area 45
FMA:68643	Brodmann area 46, or BA46, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. It is between BA10 and BA45. BA46 is known as middle frontal area 46. In the human it occupies approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex. Cytoarchitecturally, BA46 is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, rostroventrally by the frontopolar area 10 and caudally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909). There is some discrepancy between the extent of BA8 (Brodmann-1905) and the same area as described by Walker (1940)	UBERON:0006483	Brodmann (1909) area 46
FMA:68644	Brodmann area 47, or BA47, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Curving from the lateral surface of the frontal lobe into the ventral (orbital) frontal cortex. It is below areas BA10 and BA45, and beside BA11. This area is also known as orbital area 47. In the human, on the orbital surface it surrounds the caudal portion of the orbital sulcus (H) from which it extends laterally into the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally by the triangular area 45, medially by the prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909, and rostrally by the frontopolar area 10 (Brodmann-1909). It incorporates the region that Brodmann identified as 'Area 12' in the monkey, and therefore, following the suggestion of Michael Petrides, some contemporary neuroscientists refer to the region as 'BA47/12. ' BA47 has been implicated in the processing of syntax in spoken and signed languages, and more recently in musical syntax.	UBERON:0006484	Brodmann (1909) area 47

These vessels do not anastomose with each other, but form what are called end-arteries. In their outward course they give off lateral branches; these are the afferent vessels for the renal corpuscles; they enter the capsule, and end in the glomerulus. From each tuft the corresponding efferent vessel arises, and, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent vessel enters, breaks up into a number of branches, which form a dense plexus within Bowman's capsule.

Each gland opens into the lumen by a long duct which pierces the muscularis mucosae (Wilson and Washington, 1989). A sphincter is situated at the point where the oesophagus enters the stomach to prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux, i.e. to prevent acidic gastric contents from reaching stratified epithelia of the oesophagus, where they can cause inflammation and irritation (Wilson and Washington, 1989; Brown et al., 1993).

FMA:72468	The oral pontine reticular nucleus is delineated from its caudal brother, with which it shares its first three names. This nucleus tapers into the lower mesencephalic reticular formation and contains sporadic giant cells. Different populations of the pontis oralis have displayed discharge patterns which coordinate with phasic movements to and from paradoxical sleep. From this information it has been implied that the n.r. pontis oralis is involved in the mediation of changing to and from REM sleep. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002999	oral pontine reticular nucleus
FMA:72469	The caudal pontine reticular nucleus is composed of gigantocellular neurons. In rabbits and cats it is exclusively giant cells, however in humans there are normally sized cells as well. The pontis caudalis is rostral to the gigantocellular nucleus and is located in the caudal pons, as the name would indicate. The pontis caudalis has been known to mediate head movement, in concert with the nucleus gigantocellularis and the superior colliculus. The neurons in the dorsal half of this nuclei fire rhythmically during mastication, and in an anesthetized animal it is possible to induce mastication via electrical stimulation of the PC or adjacent areas of the gigantocellular nucleus. The pontis caudalis is also thought to play a role in the grinding of teeth during sleep.	UBERON:0002963	caudal pontine reticular nucleus

FMA:72471	The tegmental pontine reticular nucleus (or pontine reticular nucleus of the tegmentum) is an area within the floor of the midbrain. This area is known to affect the cerebellum with its axonal projections. These efferent connections have been proven to project not only ipsilaterally, but also to decussate and project to the contralateral side of the vermis. It has also been shown that the projections from the tegmenti pontis to the cerebellar lobes are only crossed fibers. The n.r. tegmenti pontis also receives afferent axons from the cerebellum. This nucleus is known for its large amount of multipolar cells and its particularly reticular structure. The n.r. tegmenti pontis is topographically related to pontine nuclei (non-reticular), being just dorsal to them. The nucleus reticularis has been known to mediate eye movements, otherwise known as so-called saccadic movement. This makes sense concerning their connections as it would require a nucleus which receives and projects to the cerebellum to mediate that kind of complex circuitry. Also, behaviorally this makes sense as no one thinks about saccadic movements when scanning a room and the saccadic movements are not directly controlled by the cortex. The nuclei of the cerebellum are the most traditionally studied mostly because it is easy to see which nuclei degrade when the cerebellum is amputated. The neurons of the lateral reticular formation are very important for reflexes and the mediation of posture. It has been shown in cats that electrical stimulation of the reticular formation can make a standing cat lie down. Conversely if the cat is stimulated in an alternate spot it can make a lying cat stand.	UBERON:0002147	reticulotegmental nucleus

Cells in PMD are also immunoreactive to nNOS, and immunoreactivity to a neurofilament protein shows many labeled cells and fibers.

FMA:72584	The nucleus raphe magnus, located directly rostral to the raphe obscurus, is afferently stimulated from axons in the spinal cord and cerebellum. This makes the magnus a likely candidate for part of the motor system; however, it seems to participate in the endogenous analgesia system. The magnus receives descending afferents from the periaqueductal gray, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, parvocellular reticular nucleus and the prelimbic, infralimbic, medial and lateral precentral cortices . All of these brain areas influence the main function of the raphe magnus. The main function of the magnus is mostly pain mediation; in fact it sends projections to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to directly inhibit pain. The periaquiductal gray, the epicenter of analgesia, sends efferent connections to the nucleus raphe magnus in when it is stimulated by opiates (endogenous or otherwise). Electrical stimulation of the PAG produces analgesia, as well as administration of morphine to the PAG or n.r. magnus. The antinociceptic effects of electrical stimulation of the PAG can be blocked by administering naloxone, an opiate antagonist, to the n.r. magnus. All of this seems to indicate that the magnus is part of the endogenous opiate system, and acts to inhibit pain in the spinal cord. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002156	nucleus raphe magnus
FMA:72585	The raphe obscurus projects to the cerebellar lobes VI and VII and to crus II along with the nucleus raphe pontis . This so called obscure nucleus has also been implicated in the modulation of the hypoglossal nerve. It has been observed that the ablation of this nucleus causes a change in the firing pattern in the XII nerve . In addition, the raphe obscurus mediates expiration via the inhibitory effect of serotonin and depresses periodic synaptic potentials . It has also been shown that this nucleus stimulates gastrointestinal motor function; microinjections of 5-HT into the n.r. obscurus increase gastric movement . [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002684	nucleus raphe obscurus
FMA:72586	The nucleus raphe pallidus receives afferent connections from the periaqueductal gray, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, and parvocellular reticular nucleus. Also, the pallidus receives afferents from the medial preoptic area, median preoptic nucleus and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei . The pallidus has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of a fever as an immunoreaction. It has been implied that the preoptic area is constantly inhibiting the raphe pallidus, especially the rostral portion, with GABA. When the preoptic area receives immune signals from the body, the inhibition stops and the rostral portion of the raphe pallidus excites the intermediolateral cell column, which induces a fever . The raphe pallidus has also been known to mediate the tachycardia response, an extremely high heart rate known to be incited by emotional or psychological stress. Microinjections of a GABA-a antagonist into the raphe pallidus, induces an increased heart rate. Conversely, microinjections of muscimol, a GABA-a agonist, inhibit tachycardia in rats under air-stress stimuli. In both of these cases, GABA is mediating two different sympathetic responses, so clearly the nucleus raphe pallidus is a far more a complex nucleus than previously thought. [WP,unvetted].

In non-human mammals it is a large structure. In humans this mass averages about 1 cm in length in its antero-posterior diameter. It sometimes consists of two parts and occasionally is absent. The interthalamic adhesion is found in 70-80% of humans. It is present more often in females and larger than in males by an average of 53 percent. . When absent in development, no noticeable deficit has been observed.

FMA:74993	A pennate muscle (also called a penniform muscle) is a muscle with fascicles that attach obliquely (in a slanting position) to its tendon. These types of muscles generally allow better stabilization and force production but less flexibility. Individual muscle fibers are formed into bundles of fasciculi and these bundles of fasciculi are formed into bundles of fascicles which compose the entire muscle itself. In a pennate muscle, the fascicles will form an angle with its central tendon. If all the fascicles are on the same side of the tendon, the pennate muscle is called unipennate. Examples of this include certain muscles in the manus. If there are fascicles on both sides of the central tendon, the pennate muscle is called bipennate. The rectus femoris, a large muscle in the quadriceps, is typical. If the central tendon branches within a pennate muscle, the muscle is called multipennate, as seen in the deltoid muscle in the shoulder.	UBERON:0008245	pennate muscle

FMA:75436	The first step in ossification of the cartilage is that the cartilage cells, at the point where ossification is commencing and which is termed a ossification center, enlarge and arrange themselves in rows. The matrix in which they are imbedded increases in quantity, so that the cells become further separated from each other. A deposit of calcareous material now takes place in this matrix, between the rows of cells, so that they become separated from each other by longitudinal columns of calcified matrix, presenting a granular and opaque appearance. Here and there the matrix between two cells of the same row also becomes calcified, and transverse bars of calcified substance stretch across from one calcareous column to another. Thus there are longitudinal groups of the cartilage cells enclosed in oblong cavities, the walls of which are formed of calcified matrix which cuts off all nutrition from the cells; the cells, in consequence, atrophy, leaving spaces called the primary areolC&.

FMA:75438	Anatomical structure that is a membranous gap between bones of the skull[TAO]. In humans: Fontanelles are soft spots on a baby's head which, during birth, enable the bony plates of the skull to flex, allowing the child's head to pass through the birth canal. The ossification of the bones of the skull cause the fontanelles to close over by a child's second birthday. The closures eventually form the sutures of the neurocranium. Although there are the two anterior and posterior fontanelles, there are two more fontanelles of interest, the mastoid fontanelle, and the sphenoidal fontanelle[WP].	UBERON:0002221	fontanelle
FMA:75439	In humans, the anterior fontanelle (bregmatic fontanelle, frontal fontanelle) is the largest, and is placed at the junction of the sagittal suture, coronal suture, and frontal suture; it is lozenge-shaped, and measures about 4 cm in its antero-posterior and 2.5 cm in its transverse diameter. The fontanelle allows the skull to deform during birth to ease its passage through the birth canal and for expansion of the brain after birth. While the posterior and lateral fontanelles are obliterated by about six months after birth, the anterior is not completely closed until about the middle of the second year. Full ossification starts in the late twenties and finishes before the age of 50 . [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002510	anterior fontanel

FMA:75447	A primary ossification center is the first area of a bone to start ossifying. It usually appears during prenatal development in the central part of each developing bone. In long bones the primary centers occur in the diaphysis/shaft and in irregular bones the primary centers occur usually in the body of the bone. Most bones have only one primary center (e.g. all long bones) but some irregular bones such as the os coxa (hip) and vertebrae have multiple primary centers.

FMA:75657	Houston's valves (or transverse folds of rectum) are semi-lunar transverse folds of the rectal wall that protrude into the anal canal. Their use seems to be to support the weight of fecal matter, and prevent its urging toward the anus, which would produce a strong urge to defecate. Although the term rectum means straight, these transverse folds overlap each other during the empty state of the intestine to such an extent that, as Houston remarked, they require considerable maneuvering to conduct an instrument along the canal, as often occurs in sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. These folds are about 12 mm. in width and are composed of the circular muscle coat of the rectum. They are usually three in number; sometimes a fourth is found, and occasionally only two are present. One is situated near the commencement of the rectum, on the right side. A second extends inward from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum. A third, the largest and most constant, projects backward from the forepart of the rectum, opposite the fundus of the urinary bladder. When a fourth is present, it is situated nearly 2.5 cm above the anus on the left and posterior wall of the tube.	UBERON:0017626	transverse folds of rectum

FMA:77821	At the hinder part of the medial wall of the vestibule is the orifice of the vestibular aqueduct, which extends to the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. It transmits a small vein, and contains a tubular prolongation of the membranous labyrinth, the ductus endolymphaticus, which ends in a cul-de-sac between the layers of the dura mater within the cranial cavity.

FMA:77829	A membrane inside the cochlea of the inner ear. It separates scala media from scala vestibuli. Together with the basilar membrane it creates a compartment in the cochlea filled with endolymph, which is important for the function of the organ of Corti. It primarily functions as a diffusion barrier, allowing nutrients to travel from the perilymph to the endolymph of the membranous labyrinth. Histologically, the membrane is composed of two layers of flattened epithelium, separated by a basal lamina. Its structure suggests that its function is transport of fluid and electrolytes.

FMA:77856	Portion of tissue (or germinal matrix) upon which the nail rests, the part of the nail bed that extends beneath the nail root and contains nerves, lymph and blood vessels. The matrix is responsible for the production of the cells that become the nail plate. The width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip itself determines if the nail plate is flat, arched, or hooked. The matrix will continue to grow as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition. As new nail plate cells are incubated, they emerge from the matrix round and white to push older nail plate cells forward; and in this way yet older cells become compressed, flat, and translucent, making the pink colour of the capillaries in the nail bed below visible[WP].	UBERON:0002283	nail matrix

FMA:77859	Thickened layer of skin surrounding fingernails and toenails. Beneath the cuticle is a thin layer of a membrane known as the pterygium. The function is to protect the area between the nail and epidermis from exposure to harmful bacteria. The vascularization pattern is similar to that of perionychium. The eponychium is the end of the proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed nail plate. This layer of non-living, almost invisible skin is the cuticle that 'rides out' on the surface of the nail plate. Together, the eponychium and the cuticle form a protective seal. The cuticle on the nail plate is dead cells and is often removed during manicure, but the eponychium is living cells and should not be touched.[6] The perionyx is the projecting edge of the eponychium covering the proximal strip of the lunula[WP].

FMA:7952	The facet of the tubercle of the rib forms an articulation with the adjacent transverse process of a thoracic vertebra. This is a plane type synovial joint called the costotransverse joint. This articulation is present in all but the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Ribs 1 to 10 have two joints in close proximity posteriorly; the costovertebral joints and the costotranseverse joints. This arrangement restrains the motion of the ribs allowing them to work in a parallel fashion during breathing. If a typical rib had only one joint posteriorly the resultant swivel action would allow a rib to be non-parallel with respect to the neighboring ribs making for a very inefficient respiratory mechanism. The ventral rami innervate the costotransverse joints. Therefore, therapeutic medial branch blocks are ineffectual.

This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. The three cellular components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells, and juxtaglomerular cells (also known as granular cells)[WP].

The spine of the scapula separates the supraspinatus muscle from the infraspinatus muscle, which originates below the spine. [WP,unvetted].	UBERON:0002383	supraspinatus muscle
FMA:9630	Superficial fascia is found in the subcutis in most regions of the body, blending with the reticular layer of the dermis. It is present on the face, over the upper portion of the sternocleidomastoid, at the nape of the neck, and overlying the sternum. It is comprised mainly of loose areolar connective tissue and adipose and is the layer that primarily determines the shape of a body. In addition to its subcutaneous presence, this type of fascia surrounds organs and glands, neurovascular bundles, and is found at many other locations where it fills otherwise unoccupied space. It serves as a storage medium of fat and water; as a passageway for lymph, nerve and blood vessels; and as a protective padding to cushion and insulate. Superficial fascia is present, but does not contain fat, in the eyelids, ear, scrotum, penis and clitoris.	UBERON:0011818	superficial fascia
